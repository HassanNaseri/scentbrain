Overview
Within the IFRA Volume of Use Survey, reporting on natural ingredients — specifically Natural Complex Substances (NCSs) — presents particular challenges. This is largely due to the fact that many NCSs exist in multiple qualities, each with significantly different compositions. Such variations arise from differences in geographical origin, extraction methods, and the plant parts used.

Unlike chemically defined ingredients, for which the CAS number typically provides a sufficiently precise identifier of the molecular structure, the CAS numbers assigned to NCSs are often too broad. They do not reflect the full complexity of these substances and may cover a wide range of extracts and processing methods under a single definition.

To address this limitation, IFRA and the Research Institute for Fragrance Materials (RIFM) have established a specific nomenclature system to more accurately characterize the NCSs used in the fragrance industry. In addition to the CAS number, this system incorporates a nomenclature based on the ISO 9235 Standard (2nd Edition, 2013-12-01). It consists of:

A letter representing the part of the plant used in the preparation of the NCS; and
A number indicating extraction method or other processing applied.
Letters representing the part of the plant used are defined as
A. Root (e.g. Angelica root oil)

B. Moss (e.g. Oakmoss extract)

C. Bark (e.g. Cinnamon bark oil)

D. Wood (e.g. Sandalwood oil)

E. Leaf/​Twig (e.g. Petitgrain oil, Peppermint oil) where leaves, twigs or stems are the main target of the harvest but may include other aerial parts.

F. Flower (e.g. Rose petals oil) where the flower is the main target of the harvest.

G. Fruit (e.g. Orange peel oil)

H. Seed or grain (e.g. Coriander seed oil)

I. Algae (e.g. Seaweed absolute)

J. Animal by-products (e.g. Beeswax absolute)

K. Exudate (e.g. Olibanum oil)

L. Twig (e.g. Clove stem oil)

M. Multiple (e.g. Fusel oil; could be obtained from grain, grape, rice, etc.)
